# Project Description
 Choosing a major is a significant decision for
 college students, and it can be challenging to make
 the right choice. With so many options available,
 students often struggle to identify their interests,
 strengths, and career goals. To address this
 challenge, we have developed an expert system
 designed to help students choose the best major
 based on their personality, values, passions, and
 what they are interested in.
